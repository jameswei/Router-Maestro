# Metrics and Observability

Router-Maestro exposes HTTP-layer observability for local or self-hosted
deployments. The first observability layer is intentionally narrow:

- a top-level Prometheus scrape endpoint at `/metrics`
- HTTP request counters
- HTTP request duration histograms
- request IDs propagated through `X-Request-ID`

Provider, fallback, and streaming-specific metrics are planned separately. In
this layer, provider-side failures are visible through the HTTP status and
request ID that connects the client response to server logs.

## Scraping `/metrics`

For a local server:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics
```

For a Docker container published on port 8080:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics
```

For a remote HTTPS deployment:

```bash
curl https://api.example.com/metrics
```

The endpoint returns Prometheus text format. A minimal Prometheus scrape config
for a local server looks like this:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: router-maestro
    metrics_path: /metrics
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:8080"]
```

## Metrics Token

By default, `/metrics` is public so local Prometheus can scrape it without
sharing the Router-Maestro API key. To require a dedicated token, set
`ROUTER_MAESTRO_METRICS_TOKEN` on the server:

```bash
ROUTER_MAESTRO_METRICS_TOKEN="metrics-secret" router-maestro server start --port 8080
```

Then send the token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer metrics-secret"
```

The metrics token is independent from the Router-Maestro server API key. It
does not grant access to model, auth, or admin APIs.

Prometheus can send the token like this:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: router-maestro
    metrics_path: /metrics
    bearer_token: metrics-secret
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:8080"]
```

## HTTP Metrics

### `router_maestro_http_requests_total`

Counter for completed HTTP requests handled by Router-Maestro.

Labels:

| Label | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `method` | HTTP method, such as `GET` or `POST`. |
| `path_template` | FastAPI route template, such as `/api/openai/v1/models`. |
| `status` | HTTP status code as a string, such as `200`, `401`, or `500`. |

Unmatched routes use `path_template="unmatched"` so random 404 paths do not
create high-cardinality Prometheus labels.

### `router_maestro_http_request_duration_seconds`

Histogram for completed HTTP request duration.

Labels:

| Label | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `method` | HTTP method, such as `GET` or `POST`. |
| `path_template` | FastAPI route template, or `unmatched` for 404 routes. |
| `status` | HTTP status code as a string. |

Buckets are tuned for LLM proxy traffic:

```text
0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 60, 120 seconds
```

## Request IDs

Router-Maestro accepts an inbound `X-Request-ID` header. If the client does not
provide one, the server generates a request ID. The same value is:

- stored on the request for route and middleware code
- written to request entry and exit logs
- returned to the client in the `X-Request-ID` response header

This includes framework-generated 500 responses. When reporting a failed
request, include the `X-Request-ID` value from the response so operators can
find the matching server logs.

Example:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/openai/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-rm-..." \
  -H "X-Request-ID: req-debug-001" \
  -i
```

## Troubleshooting

### `/metrics` returns 401

`ROUTER_MAESTRO_METRICS_TOKEN` is set on the server. Send the same value with
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

Do not use the Router-Maestro server API key unless you deliberately set the
metrics token to the same value. The two tokens are independent.

### Random 404 paths are increasing

Use the `unmatched` label to watch aggregate 404 volume:

```promql
sum(rate(router_maestro_http_requests_total{path_template="unmatched"}[5m]))
```

Random request paths should not appear as `path_template` label values. If they
do, treat it as a label-cardinality bug.

### Clients report 401 responses

Check the authenticated API route labels:

```promql
sum by (path_template) (
  rate(router_maestro_http_requests_total{status="401"}[5m])
)
```

401s usually mean the client sent the wrong Router-Maestro server API key. Run:

```bash
router-maestro server show-key
```

Then compare it with the key configured in the client.

### Clients report 5xx responses

Start with status and route labels:

```promql
sum by (path_template, status) (
  rate(router_maestro_http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])
)
```

Then ask the client for the `X-Request-ID` response header and search the
server logs for that request ID.

### Requests are slow

Use the duration histogram by route:

```promql
histogram_quantile(
  0.95,
  sum by (le, path_template) (
    rate(router_maestro_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])
  )
)
```

This shows Router-Maestro HTTP-level latency. Provider and streaming-specific
latency metrics are planned for the next observability layer.
