"""Reasoning effort ↔ thinking budget mapping.

OpenAI-style ``reasoning_effort`` (``"low"``/``"medium"``/``"high"``) and
Anthropic-style ``thinking.budget_tokens`` (integer) are normalised through
this module so that every entry-route and every provider speaks the same
language.

``"xhigh"`` and ``"max"`` are Router-Maestro extensions above OpenAI's spec —
when sent to an upstream that does not accept them, providers downgrade to
the highest tier the upstream supports.
