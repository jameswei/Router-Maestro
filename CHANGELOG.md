# Changelog

All notable changes to Router-Maestro are documented here.

---

## Unreleased

### Features

- **HTTP observability foundation.** Added a top-level Prometheus `/metrics`
  endpoint with HTTP request counters, HTTP duration histograms, optional
  `ROUTER_MAESTRO_METRICS_TOKEN` protection, and `X-Request-ID` response
  headers so failed requests can be correlated with server logs.

---

## v0.3.23 (2026-06-08)

### Fixes

- **Codebase review batch — correctness, security, and streaming hardening (#97).**
  - `tool_choice` translation now handles the typed `AnthropicToolChoice` object;
    previously it always resolved to `None`, so forced/any/specific tool choice
    was silently dropped on every Anthropic request.
  - Responses streaming hoists the response id/timestamp so an early provider
    error emits a clean `response.failed` event instead of a silent empty stream.
  - Native Anthropic streaming now surfaces tool calls, usage, thinking, and the
    real stop reason (previously only text deltas with a hardcoded `stop`).
  - Replayed assistant `thinking` blocks are dropped from OpenAI-format content
    so multi-turn history is no longer poisoned with raw reasoning text.
  - Config and auth files are written atomically (temp file + `os.replace` +
    `fsync`) and load behind JSON/validation error handling, so a corrupt or
    non-object file can't crash startup or lose credentials.
  - Copilot token refresh is serialized with a lock and saved off the event loop;
    API-key comparison is constant-time over UTF-8 bytes (non-ASCII keys → 401,
    not 500); streaming error paths emit `data: [DONE]`; thinking budgets that
    exceed output headroom resolve to disabled instead of an invalid value;
    OAuth session state uses an async lock; admin errors no longer leak raw
    exception text.

---

## v0.3.22 (2026-06-08)

### Fixes

- **Claude Code 2.1 mid-conversation system blocks are accepted (#95).** Handle the
  Claude Code 2.1 beta that interleaves `system` content mid-conversation.

### Chores

- Bump `softprops/action-gh-release` to v3 in the release workflow (#94).

---

## v0.3.21 (2026-06-08)

### Features

- **`reasoning_effort=max` and 1M-context keys for Opus 4.8 / Sonnet 4.6 (#92).**
  Add `max` (and `xhigh` where advertised) to the shared reasoning ladder and
  drive Copilot's catalog-advertised top tier instead of a hardcoded `high`, so
  Opus 4.6/4.7/4.8 reasoning requests are no longer silently downgraded.

---

## v0.3.20 (2026-06-04)

### Fixes

- **Auto-compact prompt handles native 1M model keys (#90).** Adjust the CLI
  auto-compact prompt so it behaves correctly for models exposed with native
  1M-context keys.

---

## v0.3.19 (2026-06-04)

### Fixes

- **Auto-compact window aligns with Copilot's picker display (#88).** Use the
  model's context window so the auto-compact upstream value matches what
  Copilot's picker shows.

---

## v0.3.18 (2026-06-04)

### Features

- **Prompt for `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW` after model selection (#86).**
  The CLI now offers to configure the auto-compact window once a model is chosen.

---

## v0.3.17 (2026-06-04)

### Fixes

- **Revert integer cache-token fields on Anthropic responses (#84).** Reverts the
  v0.3.16 change (#82), which caused a regression.

---

## v0.3.16 (2026-06-04)

### Fixes

- **Emit integer cache-token fields on Anthropic responses (#82).**
  _(Reverted in v0.3.17.)_

### Documentation

- Simplify README onboarding and clarify the API-key concept (#81).
- Clarify deployment API-key setup (#80).

### Tests

- Expand the live integration matrix.

---

## v0.3.15 (2026-05-21)

### Fixes

- **GitHub Copilot requests now honor endpoint metadata from the token response.**
  Router-Maestro persists Copilot's advertised API endpoint during login and token
  refresh, then uses that endpoint for chat, model listing, and Responses API calls.
  Copilot requests also carry the expanded compatibility headers, `X-Initiator`,
  recursive Responses vision detection, and a narrower retry/backoff path for
  transient token-refresh failures.
- **Local integration tests now run the full Copilot model matrix by default.**
  `make integration-test` covers the full available Copilot matrix unless
  `RM_INTEGRATION_MAX_MODELS=<N>` is set intentionally. The matrix now gives
  reasoning-heavy Gemini models enough output budget and avoids exposing
  completion-only Copilot catalog entries as Router-Maestro chat models.

---

## v0.3.14 (2026-05-21)

### Fixes

- **Provider routing and compatibility paths are covered by live local validation.**
  Added a local-only integration suite that starts Router-Maestro, reuses existing
  local config/auth, and calls the real GitHub Copilot backend across OpenAI Chat,
  OpenAI Responses, Anthropic Messages/count_tokens, Gemini generateContent/stream/countTokens,
  streaming, tool calls, usage accounting, and a configurable Copilot model matrix.
  These tests run only via `make integration-test`; use
  `RM_INTEGRATION_MAX_MODELS=0 make integration-test` for the full model matrix.
- **GitHub Copilot tool-call responses now report the correct finish reason.**
  Copilot can return `tool_calls` while still marking the choice as `stop`; Router-Maestro
  now normalizes those non-streaming and streaming responses to `tool_calls` so OpenAI,
  Anthropic, and Gemini compatibility layers preserve tool-use semantics.
- Hardened review findings around provider-scoped fuzzy routing, streaming fallback,
  authenticated route configuration errors, owner-only config/auth file writes, OpenAI
  request option passthrough, Anthropic tool conversion, and model-list routing through
  the singleton router.

---

## v0.3.13 (2026-05-21)

### Fixes

- **GitHub Copilot token usage now reaches clients across the affected response paths.**
  Copilot chat streaming now requests upstream usage chunks with
  `stream_options: {"include_usage": true}`, and the OpenAI Chat streaming route emits
  usage-only chunks instead of dropping them. OpenAI Chat usage now preserves
  `prompt_tokens_details` and `completion_tokens_details`, and non-streaming Responses API
  responses preserve `input_tokens_details` and `output_tokens_details`.
- Ignore the local `.codex/` project config directory so generated Codex settings do not show
  up as untracked repository files.

---

## v0.3.11 (2026-05-13)

### Fixes

- **MCP `function_call` round-trips finally work end-to-end (Kusto, ado-mcp, context7, …).** v0.3.8/9/10 each tried to preserve the `namespace` field along the assistant→model→assistant path, and each failed because the field was already gone by the time their fix-points executed. The actual root cause was upstream of every previous fix: `ResponsesFunctionCallInput` in `schemas/responses.py` is a Pydantic v2 `BaseModel`, which **silently drops unknown fields by default**. When Codex CLI POSTed a `function_call` item with `{type, call_id, name, arguments, status, namespace}`, FastAPI parsed it through that schema and the `namespace` field was discarded *before* `convert_input_to_internal` ever saw it. Every "namespace preservation" added in v0.3.8/9/10 was reading from a dict that had already been stripped at the request boundary. Fix: add `model_config = ConfigDict(extra="allow")` to `ResponsesFunctionCallInput` (and `ResponsesFunctionCallOutput` for symmetry), plus declare `namespace: str | None = None` explicitly so it shows up in `model_dump()`. Three new schema-level regression tests (`test_pydantic_input_model_preserves_namespace`, `test_pydantic_input_model_preserves_unknown_extras`, `test_responses_request_preserves_namespace_through_full_parse`) drive the schema directly — these would have caught the bug in v0.3.8 if they'd existed.
  - Lesson worth keeping: when a Pydantic schema sits on a request boundary, ALL field-preservation tests must drive the schema, not bypass it. Calling `convert_input_to_internal` with a hand-built dict (as the v0.3.8 tests did) skipped the very layer that was dropping the field.

---

## v0.3.10 (2026-05-13)

### Fixes

- **MCP `function_call` round-trips no longer drop the `namespace` field mid-stream.** v0.3.8 added namespace preservation on the dataclass and v0.3.9 stopped dropping the namespace tool registry, but Kusto MCP still 400'd with `Missing namespace for function_call 'execute_query'. It does not exist in the default namespace. Round-trip the model's function_call item with its namespace field included.` The remaining bug was in the SSE event ordering inside `copilot.py`: Copilot CAPI sends function_call events in the order `output_item.added` → `function_call_arguments.delta` × N → `function_call_arguments.done` → `output_item.done`, and the **`namespace` field is only present on the final `output_item.done` event** (matching codex's `ev_function_call_with_namespace` test fixture in `codex-rs/core/tests/common/responses.rs:829-844`). The streaming parser was emitting the `ResponsesToolCall` on `function_call_arguments.done` and popping the bookkeeping entry, so when `output_item.done` arrived with the namespace, the fallback `if fc is not None` branch never ran. Emission is now deferred to `output_item.done` for all function_call items, with the in-progress dict kept alive (`pending_fcs.get` instead of `pop`) on `function_call_arguments.done`. The namespace, arguments, and item identity all come from the canonical `output_item.done` payload, with the bookkeeping dict only used as a fallback for sparse items. A new regression test (`test_emission_deferred_until_output_item_done`) reproduces the exact production wire shape that v0.3.8 and v0.3.9 missed.

---

## v0.3.9 (2026-05-13)

### Fixes

- **MCP tool registries (Kusto, ado-mcp, context7, …) actually reach the model now.** v0.3.8 preserved the `namespace` field on `function_call` round-trips, but the underlying MCP tool calls still 400'd with `Missing namespace for function_call 'execute_query'. It does not exist in the default namespace.` because we were silently dropping the namespace tool registry itself from the request. The Codex `/responses` request carries tools shaped as `{"type": "namespace", "name": "mcp__kusto_mcp__", "tools": [{"type": "function", "name": "execute_query", ...}, ...]}` — a wrapper around the actual function definitions. We were filtering ALL `type: "namespace"` items out (added in an earlier release to suppress a `Missing required parameter: 'tools[N].tools'` 400 from Copilot), so the model received `tool_search_call` results referencing tools Copilot's request validator had no record of. The filter now keeps namespace items that carry a non-empty inner `tools` array (the legitimate registry shape) and only drops the empty/missing variants that were the original 400's actual cause.

---

## v0.3.8 (2026-05-13)

### Fixes

- **MCP tool calls (Kusto, ado-mcp, context7, …) no longer 400 mid-stream.** v0.3.7 unblocked Codex's MCP discovery via `tool_search`, so the model could finally see and call namespaced MCP tools — but the very next turn died with `Copilot API error: 400 - Missing namespace for function_call 'execute_query'. It does not exist in the default namespace. Round-trip the model's function_call item with its namespace field included.` Copilot CAPI attaches a `namespace` field (e.g. `"kusto"`) to MCP-routed `function_call` items; Codex echoes that field back on the next turn so Copilot can resolve which MCP server owns the tool. Router-Maestro stripped the field at three points — `copilot.py`'s `output_item.added`/`output_item.done` parsers, the `_extract_tool_calls` non-streaming path, and `responses.py`'s `convert_input_to_internal()` — because each layer used an explicit field whitelist. The whitelists now include `namespace`, the `ResponsesToolCall` dataclass carries it through, and `make_function_call_item` emits it on the wire when present (and omits the key entirely when absent, so non-MCP tool calls keep their old shape and Copilot doesn't see a literal `null`).
  - Reference: agent-maestro uses zod `looseObject()` (`agent-maestro/src/server/schemas/openai.ts:541-548`) which preserves unknown fields automatically — the same dynamic that protected it from this bug.

---

## v0.3.7 (2026-05-13)

### Fixes

- **Codex's `tool_search` (MCP discovery) actually works now.** v0.3.5 unblocked gpt-5.5 by forwarding Copilot's `tool_search_call` events as `function_call(name="tool_search")` items. That was wrong: Codex's tool dispatcher (`codex-rs/core/src/tools/router.rs`) matches on `ResponseItem::ToolSearchCall` specifically — the function-call shape with `name="tool_search"` is looked up in Codex's function-tool registry, finds nothing (because `tool_search` is a top-level tool type, not a function), and the call gets silently aborted. Codex writes `function_call_output: 'aborted'` to the conversation, the model sees the abort, retries verbatim, and loops forever. The route now emits an actual `tool_search_call` item with `execution: "client"` and a dict-shaped `arguments` payload, matching the wire format codex's SSE parser asserts on (`codex-rs/codex-api/src/sse/responses.rs::parses_tool_search_call_items`). This restores `/init`, MCP discovery, and any other gpt-5.x flow that goes through `tool_search`.
  - Internal: `ResponsesToolCall` gained a `kind: Literal["function", "custom", "tool_search"]` field that drives the route's branch selection. The legacy `is_custom: bool` is now a derived `@property` so existing call sites (and any out-of-tree consumers) keep working.

---

## v0.3.6 (2026-05-13)

### Fixes

- **Streaming responses no longer crash with `Internal server error` when log messages contain bracket-syntax.** v0.3.5 made it more likely we'd hit a latent bug introduced earlier: the console `RichHandler` was configured with `markup=True`, so any log line containing user-supplied content with bracket sequences that look like Rich markup tags (e.g. Codex file references like `[/Users/likanwen/.codex/config.toml:55]` echoed back inside the request payload that `copilot.py` debug-logs at `responses_completion_stream`) raised `MarkupError` from inside `logger.debug()`. The exception propagated out of the `async for chunk in stream` loop in `routes/responses.py` and aborted the SSE response after ~20ms, surfacing to the client as `stream disconnected before completion: Internal server error`. The handler is now created with `markup=False`, so log messages are emitted as literal text — no behavior change for our own log calls (we never used Rich markup tags in log strings) and a regression test pins it down.

---

## v0.3.5 (2026-05-13)

### Fixes

- **gpt-5.5 via Codex no longer stops mid-task during exploration.** v0.3.4 fixed `apply_patch`-driven stalls; this release fixes the next variant — gpt-5.5 stopping after only "Explored" some files (e.g. when the user runs Codex's `/init`). Codex CLI ≥ v0.130 registers a `tool_search` tool (`type: "tool_search"`, `execution: "client"`) so the model can dynamically discover MCP tools; gpt-5.5 invokes it via `output_item.done` items of type `tool_search_call`, which the Copilot provider had no branch for. The event was silently bucketed into `unknown_event_counts`, Codex never received a tool call, the model "explored, said it would search, then ended the turn." The provider now translates `tool_search_call` into a regular `function_call` named `tool_search` (JSON-encoded arguments), which the route emits as standard `response.function_call_arguments.*` + `output_item.done` events — the shape Codex's client-side `tool_search` executor expects.

- **Reasoning items echoed back across turns are explicitly preserved.** `convert_input_to_internal()` now has a dedicated `type: "reasoning"` branch that forwards `id`, `summary`, and (when present) `encrypted_content` upstream — mirroring vscode-copilot-chat's `extractThinkingData` pattern. Previously these items hit a generic fallback that worked for most shapes but didn't normalize the field set, so non-Codex clients echoing slightly different reasoning shapes could leak unknown sibling fields to Copilot. This is preparation for stateful Copilot models: today Copilot CAPI for gpt-5.5 returns empty reasoning items (no encrypted content), but the input-side handler will round-trip cleanly the moment Copilot starts honoring `include: ["reasoning.encrypted_content"]`.

- **`unhandled event types` warning is no longer noisy.** Five upstream events that the route synthesizes its own equivalents from (`response.created`, `response.in_progress`, `response.content_part.added`, `response.content_part.done`, `response.output_text.done`) and one benign `output_item.done:message` are now filtered out of the diagnostic. The warning fires only when an event type genuinely needs attention, making future stream-shape regressions easier to spot.

---

## v0.3.4 (2026-05-13)

### Fixes

- **`router-maestro config codex` no longer writes invalid project-level keys.** Selecting project-level scope used to dump `model_provider` and `[model_providers.router-maestro]` into `./.codex/config.toml`, which Codex CLI 0.130+ rejects with `Ignored unsupported project-local config keys`. Project-level configs now contain only the `model = "..."` override (and inherit the provider definition from `~/.codex/config.toml`); re-running the command also self-heals existing project files written by older releases, while leaving any user-added providers untouched.

- **gpt-5.5 via Codex no longer stops mid-task before writing files.** Three gaps were causing the Responses-API stream to silently drop most of the model's output when used through Codex's `apply_patch` flow:
  1. **Custom tools were unhandled.** Codex registers `apply_patch` as a `type: "custom"` tool. gpt-5.5 streamed the patch body via `response.custom_tool_call_input.delta` (hundreds of events per call), and the Copilot provider had no branch for them — every byte of the patch was discarded, so Codex saw zero tool calls and aborted. The provider now recognizes `custom_tool_call` items, accumulates the input deltas, and the route forwards them as `custom_tool_call` events with raw `input` (not JSON `arguments`) so Codex parses them correctly.
  2. **Reasoning summaries from CAPI models were dropped.** Copilot CAPI delivers `gpt-5.x` chain-of-thought inside `output_item.done.item.summary[]` rather than as `reasoning_summary_text.delta` events. The provider now reads the summary array on `output_item.done` and forwards it as thinking chunks, with a `received_delta_summary` guard so BYOK models that stream both don't get duplicated.
  3. **`reasoning.encrypted_content` was not requested.** The Responses payload now sets `include: ["reasoning.encrypted_content"]`, matching the upstream vscode-copilot-chat reference client, so reasoning state can round-trip across turns.

  The provider also logs a one-line `unhandled event types` warning when the upstream stream contains events the bridge doesn't recognize, so future stream-shape changes are easier to spot.

---

## v0.3.3 (2026-05-08)

### Fixes

- **Streaming 4xx errors now carry the upstream response body.** When a Copilot or OpenAI-compatible upstream returned a 4xx during a streaming chat, `response.raise_for_status()` fired before the body was iterated. Reading `response.text` on a streamed-but-unread response raises `httpx.ResponseNotRead`, which the shared error helper silently swallowed — so logs and SSE `error` events showed `Copilot stream API error: 400 -` with no detail. The body is now pulled inside the `async with client.stream(...)` block, so both the log and the client's SSE error event include the actual upstream payload (e.g. `{"error":{"message":"Could not process image"}}`). Affects `chat_completion_stream` on `CopilotProvider` and the shared `OpenAIChatProvider` streaming path.

---

## v0.1.37 (2026-04-24)

### Fixes

- **`ROUTER_MAESTRO_LOG_LEVEL` is no longer silently clobbered by the CLI.** `router-maestro server start --log-level` previously hardcoded its default to `INFO` and then wrote that default into `ROUTER_MAESTRO_LOG_LEVEL` before the FastAPI app read it. Setting the env var (e.g. in `docker-compose.yml`) had no effect unless you also passed the flag. The CLI option now defaults to whatever `ROUTER_MAESTRO_LOG_LEVEL` already contains, so Docker / systemd users can flip the level via env without changing the launch command.

---

## v0.1.36 (2026-04-23)

### Features

- **Catalog-driven `reasoning_effort` dispatch on Copilot.** Read each model's `capabilities.supports.reasoning_effort` allowlist from Copilot's `/models` response and use it as the source of truth when picking which effort tier to send. When the desired tier isn't offered, step to the nearest available (prefer next higher, else next lower). The old hardcoded heuristic stays as a fallback when the catalog is silent. As a side effect, `gemini-3*` / `gpt-5-mini` / `gpt-5.4-mini` get correct reasoning routing without further code changes — and any future tier opened upstream (e.g. `high` on opus-4.7) will be picked up automatically.

---

## v0.1.35 (2026-04-23)

### Features

- **Claude reasoning passthrough on Copilot.** Surface upstream chain-of-thought back to Anthropic-compatible clients as `thinking` content blocks, with `thinking_delta` + `signature_delta` SSE events for streaming. Mirrors vscode-copilot-chat's field discovery (`reasoning_text` / `cot_summary` / `thinking` for text; `reasoning_opaque` / `cot_id` / `signature` for the signature). Gated behind explicit `thinking={type:"enabled"|"adaptive"}` so traces never leak to clients that didn't ask for them.

### Fixes

- **Per-Claude-family reasoning dispatch on Copilot.** `apply_copilot_chat_reasoning` now sends `reasoning_effort` (not `thinking_budget`) for `claude-opus-4.7` / `claude-opus-4.6*` / `claude-sonnet-4.6` — the Copilot gateway's actual control surface for those models. `opus-4.7` only accepts `medium` so we clamp; older models (`4.5`, `sonnet-4`, `haiku-4.5`) send neither field.
- Lower effort thresholds (`low=1024`, `medium=4096`, `high=8192`, `xhigh=16384`) so it's easier to reach the higher tiers — Copilot is free unlimited.
- Tolerate `choices=[]` with `completion_tokens>0` as a thinking-only success — but only on a reasoning-capable Claude AND when the client opted into thinking. Otherwise keep the 500 path so malformed upstream responses stay visible.
- Bump non-streaming HTTP read timeout 120s → 240s. `claude-opus-4.6` / `claude-sonnet-4.6` at high effort routinely take >2min on Copilot's side.

### Docs

- Drop hardcoded production domain from `CLAUDE.md`.

---

## v0.1.34 (2026-04-23)

### Fixes

- Per-model reasoning dispatch on Copilot's `/chat/completions` endpoint
  - Previously the chat path blindly forwarded `thinking_budget`, which the Copilot gateway rejects with `400 invalid_thinking_budget` for OpenAI reasoning models (`gpt-5*`, `o1`, `o3`, `o4`). This broke clients that send Anthropic-style `thinking` (e.g. Cherry Studio → `gpt-5.x`).
  - New `apply_copilot_chat_reasoning()` routes by model family: Claude keeps `thinking_budget`, GPT-5 / o-series get `reasoning_effort` (with `xhigh` preserved natively — Copilot accepts it), GPT-4 / Gemini omit both fields.
  - `gpt-5.4*` requires `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens`; the helper rewrites the field automatically.

### Logging

- Copilot chat / streaming now log `thinking_budget` and `reasoning_effort` (both incoming `ChatRequest` values and the resolved outbound payload values) at DEBUG, so operators can verify what was actually sent to the gateway.

---

## v0.1.33 (2026-04-20)

### Chores

- Re-release of v0.1.32 after a PyPI upload conflict left v0.1.32 unpublishable (no functional change)
- Apply `ruff format` to `providers/copilot.py` and `tests/test_reasoning_effort.py` ([#46](https://github.com/MadSkittles/Router-Maestro/pull/46))

---

## v0.1.32 (2026-04-20)

### Features

- End-to-end `reasoning_effort` / `thinking` passthrough across all entrypoints ([#44](https://github.com/MadSkittles/Router-Maestro/pull/44))
  - OpenAI Chat (`/api/openai/v1/chat/completions`), Responses (`/api/openai/v1/responses`), and Anthropic Messages now all accept and forward reasoning intensity
  - New `xhigh` extension level (24000 budget); auto-downgrades to `high` for OpenAI/Copilot upstreams that reject it
  - New shared `utils/reasoning.py` module with `effort_to_budget` / `budget_to_effort` mapping
  - OpenAI native provider now writes `reasoning_effort` into the upstream payload (previously dropped)

### Fixes

- Drop Codex CLI `namespace` tools before sending to Copilot ([#45](https://github.com/MadSkittles/Router-Maestro/pull/45))
  - Codex CLI groups MCP servers as `tools[].type="namespace"` entries; Copilot's Responses API rejects these with `Missing required parameter: 'tools[N].tools'`, breaking every Codex turn
  - Add `"namespace"` to `CopilotProvider.UNSUPPORTED_TOOL_TYPES` so the existing filter strips them
  - Side effect: Codex's MCP servers are not exposed through Copilot until a real MCP proxy is added

---

## v0.1.31 (2026-04-20)

### Fixes

- Accept Anthropic `document` content blocks (e.g. PDF attachments) in user messages and `tool_result` content ([#43](https://github.com/MadSkittles/Router-Maestro/pull/43))
  - Add `AnthropicDocumentBlock` / `AnthropicDocumentSource` to the user-content and tool_result-content unions, fixing a 422 `body.messages.*.content.str: Input should be a valid string` when Claude Code sent PDFs
  - Translate document blocks through `_extract_multimodal_content` in Anthropic-native shape so `AnthropicProvider` forwards them upstream verbatim
  - Documents nested inside `tool_result.content` are injected as a follow-up user message, mirroring the existing image behaviour

---

## v0.1.30 (2026-04-08)

### Fixes

- Suppress `KeyboardInterrupt` traceback when pressing Ctrl+C during CLI startup ([#42](https://github.com/MadSkittles/Router-Maestro/pull/42))
  - Add lightweight `cli/entry.py` wrapper with lazy import inside `try/except KeyboardInterrupt`
  - Ctrl+C during module import now exits cleanly with code 130 instead of dumping a full stack trace

---

## v0.1.29 (2026-04-02)

### Fixes

- Passthrough images from Anthropic `tool_result` to OpenAI format instead of silently dropping them ([#41](https://github.com/MadSkittles/Router-Maestro/pull/41))
  - Images in tool results are now extracted and injected as a follow-up user message with OpenAI multimodal `image_url` format
  - All images from multiple tool results are collected and appended after all tool messages to avoid interleaved `tool`/`user` message sequences that OpenAI rejects

---

## v0.1.28 (2026-03-31)

### Fixes

- Rename 1M option display name to "Opus 4.6 1M (Auto-activated)" to better distinguish from the internal provider model key ([#40](https://github.com/MadSkittles/Router-Maestro/pull/40))

---

## v0.1.27 (2026-03-31)

### Fixes

- Prepend `claude-opus-4-6[1m]` option at the top of the model list instead of the bottom ([#39](https://github.com/MadSkittles/Router-Maestro/pull/39))

---

## v0.1.26 (2026-03-31)

### Features

- Add Opus 4.6 1M context option to `config claude-code` wizard ([#38](https://github.com/MadSkittles/Router-Maestro/pull/38))
  - When `github-copilot/claude-opus-4.6-1m` is available, offers `claude-opus-4-6[1m]` as a selectable model that activates Claude Code's native 1M context window
  - Extracted `_fetch_models`, `_display_models`, and `_maybe_inject_opus_1m` for better testability
  - Out-of-range model selection now warns instead of silently falling back to auto-routing

### Documentation

- Highlight 1M context support and fuzzy model matching in README features
- Add ripgrep preference note to CLAUDE.md

---

## v0.1.25 (2026-03-31)

### Bug Fixes

- Fix 500 Internal Server Error caused by lone UTF-16 surrogate characters in request messages ([#37](https://github.com/MadSkittles/Router-Maestro/pull/37))
  - Sanitize message content in CopilotProvider to replace lone surrogates (e.g. `\udc8d`) before httpx JSON serialization

### Documentation

## v0.1.24 (2026-03-15)

### Bug Fixes

- Fix streaming tool call matching to use `output_index` instead of `item_id`
  - Copilot obfuscates/encrypts item IDs differently across SSE events in the same stream, making ID-based matching impossible
  - `output_index` is consistent across `output_item.added`, `arguments.delta`, `arguments.done`, and `output_item.done` events

---

## v0.1.23 (2026-03-15)

### Bug Fixes

- Fix parallel tool call state corruption in Responses API streaming ([#34](https://github.com/MadSkittles/Router-Maestro/pull/34))
  - Replace single-state `current_fc` tracker with `pending_fcs` dict keyed by item ID, so concurrent tool calls are tracked independently
- Fix duplicate/orphaned delta events with mismatched IDs in streaming tool calls ([#34](https://github.com/MadSkittles/Router-Maestro/pull/34))
  - Remove `tool_call_delta` emission from copilot provider and dead handler in responses route; the complete tool call path already reconstructs the full SSE event sequence

---

## v0.1.22 (2026-03-15)

## v0.1.18 (2026-03-06)

### Bug Fixes

- Recover tool calls from XML content when provider misplaces them ([#28](https://github.com/MadSkittles/Router-Maestro/pull/28))
  - GitHub Copilot API sometimes returns `finish_reason="tool_calls"` but embeds tool calls as `<tool_call>` XML in `message.content` instead of the proper `message.tool_calls` field
